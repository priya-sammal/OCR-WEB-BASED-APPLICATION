# OCR AND DOCUMENT SEARCH WEB APPLICATION


This project is a **Streamlit** web application that allows users to upload images containing text in both Hindi and English, extract the text using **EasyOCR**, and perform keyword searches on the extracted text using a **TensorFlow** and **Huggingface Transformers** model.
## Features
- **OCR Functionality**: Extracts text from images using EasyOCR, supporting both Hindi and English.
- **Keyword Search**: Allows users to search for specific keywords within the extracted text, utilizing Huggingface Transformers' `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` model for question-answering.
- **Simple Interface**: Streamlit-powered interface for easy interaction.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below.
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocr-search-app.git
cd ocr-search-app
```
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
# For Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The dependencies include:
- `streamlit`: For the web interface.
- `easyocr`: To perform OCR on the uploaded images.
- `tensorflow`: TensorFlow backend for Huggingface models.
- `transformers`: For text processing and NLP functionalities.
- `pillow`: For image handling.
- `torch`: Required for Huggingface Transformers models.
### 4. Run the App
Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run ocr_search_app.py
```
The app will start, and you can access it locally at `http://localhost:8501`.
## How to Use
1. **Upload an Image**: Upload an image containing text in Hindi and English (JPEG/PNG).
2. **Extract Text**: The app will automatically extract the text from the uploaded image.
3. **Keyword Search**: Enter a keyword to search for within the extracted text. The app will highlight the matching sections of the text using TensorFlow-backed question-answering models.
